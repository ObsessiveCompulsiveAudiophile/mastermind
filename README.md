# Mastermind: Weighted Entropy Heuristic Implementations

This repository contains three standalone programs implementing a weighted entropy-based heuristic for the Mastermind game, achieving an average number of guesses 4.3488:
- `kernel.cu`: CUDA-accelerated optimizer for computing stage-based weights, optimized for NVIDIA GPUs.
- `treeGenFixedWeights.cpp`: CPU-based program generating a full game tree using fixed weights.
- `treeGenStageWeights.cpp`: CPU-based program generating a full game tree using stage-based weights.

See author's paper for details on the heuristic and its performance.

## Prerequisites
- **Windows**:
  - NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit 11.8 (download from [NVIDIA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-11-8-0-download-archive)).
  - MinGW-w64 with `g++` (install via MSYS2: `pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc`).
  - NVIDIA GPU with compute capability 6.1 or higher (e.g., GTX 1080, RTX 2080, RTX 3090).
- **Linux**:
  - NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit 11.8 (install via NVIDIAâ€™s `.run` installer or `apt`).
  - `g++` (install via `sudo apt-get install g++`).
  - NVIDIA GPU with compute capability 6.1 or higher.

## Building the Programs

### Windows
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/obsessivecompulsiveaudiophile/mastermind.git
   cd mastermind
